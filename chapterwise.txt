"  . MAYCOMB, ALABAMA - DAYBREAK
We are looking down on small Southern town of Maycomb,
Alabama. It is just before dawn in half light, we
can see cotton farms, pine woods, hills surrounding
Maycomb, Courthouse Square of Maycomb itself. The
CAMERA STARTS TO SLOWLY MOVE down to Square. As we
begin to see stores offices which comprise
town, young woman’s voice is heard OFF CAMERA:
JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER)
In ",



" this was world I knew.
It wasn’t very big world, but
neither was I.
(a beat)
I was six years old.
THE CAMERA STARTS TO SLOWLY MOVE DOWN main
residential street leading away Square.
JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER)
They tell me Maycomb was tried
old town then, that people moved
slowly. There was no hurry for
there was no-where to go, nothing
to buy no money to buy it
with.
During this THE CAMERA HAS COME TO REST ON Finch
house yard. The Finch house is small frame house,
built high off ground with porch in manner
of Southern cottages of its day. The yard is large
one, filled with oaks, it all has air of mystery
about it in early morning light.
JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER)
What I remember was that I was to
begin school in two weeks, for
first time. What I didn’t know
was that my whole world was soon
to change.
WALTER CUNNINGHAM, thin, raw-boned farmer in his late
fifties, comes into view. He is carrying crocker sack
full of hickory nuts. He passes under oak tree at
the side of house as young girl, six, dressed in
blue jeans, drops one of its branches to ground.
She brushes herself off toward Mr. Cunningham.
SCOUT
Why, good morning, Mr. Cunningham.
My daddy is getting dressed.
Would you like me to call him?
CUNNINGHAM
No, ma’m. I wouldn’t care to
bother --
SCOUT
(eagerly)
Why, it’s no bother, Mr.
Cunningham. He’ll be happy to see
you.

bedroom)

Good morning, Walter.
CUNNINGHAM
Good morning, Mr. Finch. I didn’t
want to bother you none. I
brought these here as part of my
entailment.
ATTICUS
Well, I thank you. The collards we
had last week were delicious.
Atticus picks up sack. These are hickory nuts.
ATTICUS

nice.

SCOUT
Well, I thought you’d want to
thank him.
The ANGLE WIDENS as Atticus starts for front yard to
get morning paper, Scout after him.
ATTICUS
Well, I do. But I think it
embarrasses to be thanked.
SCOUT
Why does bring you all this stuff?
ATTICUS
(explaining patiently)
He’s paying me for some legal work
I did for him.
SCOUT
(curious)
Why does pay you like that?
ATTICUS
Because that’s only way
can. He has no money.
SCOUT
Is poor?
Atticus picks up paper opens it.
ATTICUS
Yes.
SCOUT
Are we poor?
ATTICUS
We are, indeed.
SCOUT
Are we as poor as Cunninghams?
ATTICUS
Not exactly. The Cunninghams are
country folks, farmers,
crash hit them hardest.

ATTICUS
To begin with, this case should
never have come to trial. The
State has not produced on iota of
medical evidence to effect
that crime Tom Robinson is
charged with ever took place. It
has relied instead upon
testimony of two witnesses whose
evidence has not only been called
into serious question on cross
examination, but has been flatly
contradicted by defendant.
There is circumstantial evidence
to indicate that Mayella Ewell was
beaten savagely by someone who led
almost exclusively with his
left... Tom Robinson now sits
before you with only good hand
he possesses... his right hand.
",


".
(MORE)
I have nothing but pity in my
heart for chief witness for
the state. She is victim of
cruel poverty ignorance -- but
my pity does not extend so far as
to putting man’s life at
stake which has done in
effort to get rid of own
guilt. I say guilt, gentlemen,
because it was guilt that
motivated her. She has committed
no crime, has merely broken
rigid time honored code of
our society, code so severe that
whoever breaks it is hounded
our midst as unfit to live with.
She must destroy evidence of
her offense. What was
evidence of offense? Tom
Robinson, human being. She must
put Tom Robinson away her.
Tom Robinson was daily
reminder of what did. What
did do? She tempted Negro.
She was white, tempted
Negro. She did something that in
our society is unspeakable: She
kissed black man. Not old
Uncle, but strong, young Negro
man. No code mattered to
before broke it, but it came
crashing down on afterwards.
The witnesses for state, with
the exception of Sheriff of
Maycomb County, have presented
themselves to you gentlemen, to
this Court, in cynical
confidence that their testimony
would not be doubted, confident
that you gentlemen would go along
with them on assumption --
evil assumption -- that all
Negroes lie, that all Negroes are
basically immoral beings, that all
Negro men are not to be trusted
around our women, assumption
one associates with minds of their
caliber, which, gentlemen, we know
is in itself lie I do not have
to point out to you. And so
quiet, respectable, humble Negro
who had unmitigated temerity
to “feel sorry” for white woman
has had to put his word against
two white people’s.

" TWO   - ATTICUS AND HECK
ATTICUS
Well, Heck, I guess thing to
do -- Good Lord, I’m losing my
memory.
",


" ANGLE FAVORING ATTICUS
Atticus pushes up his glasses presses his fingers to
his eyes.
ATTICUS
I can’t remember if Jem is ten
eleven. Anyway, it will come
before County court. Of
course, it was clear cut case of
self-defense, but I’ll have to go
to office hunt up --

" ANGLE FAVORING TATE
TATE
Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed
Bob Ewell? Do you think that?
ATTICUS
You heard what Scout said.
",


".
TATE
(quietly, firmly
Mr. Finch, Bob Ewell fell on his
knife. He killed himself. Your
boy never stabbed him.
Atticus walks to corner of porch looks at
wisteria vine.
TATE
(exploding
There’s black man dead for no
reason, now man
responsible for it is dead. Let
the dead bury dead this time,
Mr. Finch. I never heard tell
that it’s against law for
citizen to do his utmost to
prevent crime being
committed, which is exactly what
he did, but maybe you’ll say it’s
my duty to tell town all about
it not hush it up. Know what’d
happen then? All ladies in
Maycomb, includin’ my wife, ‘d be
knockin’ on his door bringin’
angel food cakes. To my way of
thinkin’, Mr. Finch, takin’
one man who’s done you this
town great service, draggin’
him with his shy ways into
limelight... To me, that’s sin.
It’s sin I’m not about to
have it on my head.
He is trying to dig hole in floor with toe of
his boot. Atticus looks over at Boo. Heck’s meaning
dawns on him.
TATE
I may not be much, Mr. Finch, but
I’m still Sheriff of Maycomb
County, Bob Ewell fell on his
knife. Good night, sir.
He LEAVES.
O.S. SOUND: CAR DRIVING OFF
Atticus looks out into yard then over at Scout.

Scout, Mr. Ewell fell on his
knife. Do you think you can
possibly understand?

SCOUT
Yes, sir. I understand. Mr. Tate
was right.
ATTICUS
What do you mean?
SCOUT
Well, it would be sort of like
shooting mockingbird, wouldn’t
it?
Atticus puts his face in hair rubs it. ANGLE
WIDENS as Atticus gets up starts for house.
Before inside, stops in front of Arthur
Radley.
ATTICUS
Thank you for my children, Arthur.

SCOUT
You can pet him, Mr. Arthur. He’s

Scout alone on porch.
JEAN LOUISE (V.O.)
Neighbors bring food with death,
and flowers with sickness,
little things in between. Boo was
our neighbor. He gave us two soap
dolls, broken watch chain,
knife our lives. One time
Atticus said you never really knew
a man until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them. Just
standing on Radley porch was
enough.

JEAN LOUISE (V.O.)
Well, summer that had begun so
long ago had ended, another
summer had taken its place,
