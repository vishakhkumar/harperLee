   "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by Horton Foote Final Screenplay Prod. #1919 February 8, 1962 To Kill a Mockingbird FADE IN: 1 EXT. MAYCOMB, ALABAMA - DAYBREAK We are looking down on the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama. It is just before dawn and in the half light, we can see cotton farms, pine woods, the hills surrounding Maycomb, and the Courthouse Square of Maycomb itself. The CAMERA STARTS TO SLOWLY MOVE down to the Square. As we begin to see the stores and the offices which comprise the town, a young woman’s voice is heard OFF CAMERA: JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER) In 1932 this was the world I knew. It wasn’t a very big world, but neither was I. (a beat) I was six years old. THE CAMERA STARTS TO SLOWLY MOVE DOWN the main residential street leading away from the Square. JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER) They tell me Maycomb was a tried old town then, that people moved slowly. There was no hurry for there was no-where to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with. During this THE CAMERA HAS COME TO REST ON the Finch house and yard. The Finch house is a small frame house, built high off the ground and with a porch in the manner of Southern cottages of its day. The yard is a large one, filled with oaks, and it all has an air of mystery about it in the early morning light. JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER) What I remember was that I was to begin school in two weeks, for the first time. What I didn’t know was that my whole world was soon to change. WALTER CUNNINGHAM, a thin, raw-boned farmer in his late fifties, comes into view. He is carrying a crocker sack full of hickory nuts. He passes under the oak tree at the side of the house as a young girl, six, dressed in blue jeans, drops from one of its branches to the ground. She brushes herself off and goes toward Mr. Cunningham. SCOUT Why, good morning, Mr. Cunningham. My daddy is getting dressed. Would you like me to call him? CUNNINGHAM No, ma’m. I wouldn’t care to bother -- SCOUT (eagerly) Why, it’s no bother, Mr. Cunningham. He’ll be happy to see you. (she calls into bedroom) Atticus. Atticus. 2 MED. SHOT - WALTER CUNNINGHAM He seems ill at ease and embarrassed. ATTICUS, Scout’s father, comes OUT of the kitchen door. SCOUT Her’s Mr. Cunningham. ATTICUS Good morning, Walter. CUNNINGHAM Good morning, Mr. Finch. I didn’t want to bother you none. I brought these here as part of my entailment. ATTICUS Well, I thank you. The collards we had last week were delicious. Atticus picks up the sack. These are hickory nuts. ATTICUS And these hickory nuts look mighty nice. Mr. Cunningham mutters something and starts on. 3 CLOSE SHOT - ATTICUS, SCOUT ATTICUS Scout, I think next time Mr. Cunningham comes, you’d better not call me. 2. SCOUT Well, I thought you’d want to thank him. The ANGLE WIDENS as Atticus starts for the front yard to get the morning paper, Scout after him. ATTICUS Well, I do. But I think it embarrasses him to be thanked. SCOUT Why does he bring you all this stuff? ATTICUS (explaining patiently) He’s paying me for some legal work I did for him. SCOUT (curious) Why does he pay you like that? ATTICUS Because that’s the only way he can. He has no money. SCOUT Is he poor? Atticus picks up the paper and opens it. ATTICUS Yes. SCOUT Are we poor? ATTICUS We are, indeed. SCOUT Are we as poor as the Cunninghams? ATTICUS Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit them the hardest. CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE Calpurnia, in her late fifties at the screen door, calling: CALPURNIA Breakfast, Scout. Call your brother. 3. Calpurnia GOES back INSIDE. SCOUT (matter of factly) Atticus, Jem is up in that tree yonder. (points toward the oak) He says he won’t come down until you agree to play football for the Methodists. Atticus walks toward the tree. In a tree-house, high in the tree, sits JEM. He is 10, with a serious, manly little face. Presently, he is scowling. ATTICUS (very calmly) Son, why don’t you come on down and have your breakfast now. Calpurnia has a good one. Hot biscuits, and... JEM No, sir. Not until you agree to play football for the Methodists. ATTICUS (wryly) Son, I can’t do that. I explained to you I’m too old to get out there. After all, I’m the only father you have and you wouldn’t want me to go out there and get my head knocked off, would you? JEM (interrupting with great indignation) Can you imagine me telling them when they ask me where my Papa is that he’s too old to be here playing football? I’m not going to come down. ATTICUS Suit yourself. Atticus starts for the kitchen door. Scout has been watching them. She follows her father into the kitchen. 4. 4 INT. KITCHEN It is a large, old-fashioned country kitchen. This is Calpurnia’s domain, and she runs it with absolute authority. There is a large kitchen range, a sink, a table and chairs for breakfast, and more informal family meals. Since Scout’s and Jem’s mother is dead, while Atticus is at work, Calpurnia has charge of the children, and the kitchen has become a retreat and headquarters for them. Atticus and Scout come into the kitchen. SCOUT Poor thing. Maybe I’d better take him a little something up there. CALPURNIA (sternly) You tend to your own marbles. Scout glumly begins to eat her breakfast. Atticus picks up the paper to read. DISSOLVE TO: 5 EXT. TREE HOUSE - MED. SHOT Jem is eating a biscuit. Scout comes climbing up the tree. She holds in one hand a napkin with some bacon. She hands it up to him, and starts down again. He leans over the edge of the tree house, calling down to her. JEM Scout, bring me a doughnut. SCOUT All right. She continues on down. JEM And some football magazines. SCOUT All right. She continues on. JEM And some blankets. 5. 6 CAMERAL PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT As Scout reaches the ground and see MISS MAUDIE ATKINSON across the street in her yard, working on her flowers. She is a strong, warm-hearted woman, keenly interested in Atticus and the children SCOUT (yelling over) Good morning, Miss Maudie-- MAUDIE What’s going on over there? SCOUT (pausing long enough to explain) I’m having a terrible time, Miss Maudie. I’m about to wear myself out. Jem is staying up in that tree until Atticus says he’ll play football with the Methodists. JEM (YELLING) He’s too old for anything. Every time I want him to do something, he’s to old. MAUDIE (YELLING) He can do plenty of things. Atticus comes out of the kitchen door, dressed for work. He seems unconcerned at all the commotion. ATTICUS You be good, children, and mind Cal. He starts on. ATTICUS Good morning, Maudie. MAUDIE Good morning, Atticus. He continues on out of the yard. JEM (YELLING over to Maudie as his father leaves the yard) He won’t let me have a gun. 6. (MORE) He’ll only play touch football with me...never tackle. MAUDIE (YELLING back) He can make somebody’s will so airtight, you can’t break it. You count your blessings and stop complaining, both of you. Just thank your stars he has the sense to act his age. She walks away. 7 MED. SHOT - SCOUT, JEM SCOUT (calling up to Jem) Jem, he is pretty old. JEM (still firm) I can’t help that. He swings down to the lower limb in disgust and looks down into MISS STEPHANIE CRAWFORD’S collard patch next door. A boy is sitting among the collards. Sitting down he is not much higher than the collards. It is DILL. He has solemn, owlish face, a knowledge and imagination too old for his years. He looks up at Jem. DILL (tentatively) Hey -- JEM Hey, yourself. 8 ANGLE - DILL DILL I’m Charles Baker Harris. I can read SCOUT So what? DILL I thought you’d like to know I can read. You got anything needs reading? I can do it. JEM How old are you? Four and a half? 7. JEM (CONT'D) DILL Going on seven. JEM Shoot, no wonder then. Scout yonder’s been reading since she was born and she don’t start school till next month. You look right puny for going on seven. DILL I’m little, but I’m old. Dill climbs through the fence. DILL Folks call me Dill. Jem climbs down the tree to get a closer look. 9 CLOSER SHOT - DILL DILL I’m from Meridian, Mississippi. I’m spending two weeks next door with my Aunt Stephanie. My mama worked for a photographer in Meridian. She entered my picture in a Beautiful Child Contest and won five dollars. She gave the money to me and I went to the picture show twenty times on it. 10 GROUP SHOT - SCOUT, DILL, JEM SCOUT Our mama’s dead. We got a daddy. Where’s your daddy DILL I haven’t got one. SCOUT Is he dead? DILL No. SCOUT Well, if he’s not dead, you’ve got one, haven’t you? Dill blushes. 8. JEM (he has decided to take Dill under his wing Hush, Scout. 11 CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT As Calpurnia comes out the kitchen door. She walks over to them. SCOUT Dill, this is Calpurnia. CALPURNIA Please to know you, Dill. DILL I’m pleased to know you. My daddy owns the L and N Railroad. He’s going to let me run the engine all the way to New Orleans. CALPURNIA (impressed) Is that so? DILL He says I can invite -- MR. RADLEY, in his seventies, a regal, austere man, walks by. Scout and Jem see him and become very subdued, as if they were afraid. Their attention leaves Dill and he senses this and looks at them to see what is happening. JEM There goes the meanest man that ever took a breath of life. Calpurnia goes back into the kitchen. 12 CLOSE SHOT - DILL, JEM DILL (his curiosity aroused) Why is he the meanest man? JEM Well, for one thing, he has a boy named Boo that he keeps chained to a bed in that house over yonder. 9. 13 MOVING SHOT - SIDEWALK - JEM, DILL, SCOUT As they start to move out of the yard, Scout follows behind them. They go down the sidewalk past Miss Stephanie’s house. JEM Boo only comes out at night when we are asleep and it’s pitch dark. When you wake up at night you can hear him. He walks like this. (he slides his feet along the sidewalk) Once I heard him scratching on our screen door, but he was gone time Atticus got there. 14 REVERSE ANGLE - EXT. RADLEY HOUSE They are standing by a light pole now, staring at the Radley house and yard. The house is low, and was once white, with a deep front porch and green shutters. But it was darkened long ago to the color of the slate grey yard around it. Rain-spotted shingles droop over the eaves of the veranda. Oak trees keep the sun away. The remains of a picket fence drunkenly guards the front yard. A “swept” yard that is never swept, where Johnson grass and Rabbit Tobacco grass grow in abundance. Dill’s eyes have widened. He is becoming truly intrigued. DILL Is that why my Aunt locks up so tight at night? JEM Sure. DILL Wonder what he does in there? Looks like he’d just stick his head out the door. What would you do if he stuck his head out the door now? SCOUT (with real terror I’d die... that’s what I’d do. 15 CLOSE TWO SHOT - DILL, JEM DILL Wonder what he looks like? 10. JEM Well, judging from his tracks, he’s about six and a half feet tall. He eats raw squirrels and all the cats he can catch. There’s a long, jagged scar running across his face. His teeth are yellow and rotten. His eyes popped. And he drools most of the time. DILL Aw, I don’t believe you. ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE Miss Stephanie Crawford, Dill’s aunt. She is in her late fifties. She is a spinster and the neighbourhood gossip. She comes up behind them without them hearing her. She has habit of half shouting when she talks. STEPHANIE Children... They jump and Dill looks as if he is about to faint. DILL (turning pale) My Lord, Aunt Stephanie, you almost gave me a heart attack. STEPHANIE Dill, I don’t want yo playing around that house over there. There’s a maniac lives there and he’s dangerous. JEM (to Dill You see. (to Stephanie I was just trying to warn him about Boo, and he wouldn’t believe me. STEPHANIE Well, you’d better believe him, Mr. Dill Harris. JEM Tell him about the time Boo tried to kill his papa. 11. STEPHANIE Well, I was standing in my yard one day when his mama come running out and yelling, “He’s killing us all.”Turned Out Boo was sitting in the living room cutting up the paper for his scrapbook and when his daddy come by, he reached over with his scissors and stabbed him in tis leg, pulled them out, and went on back cutting the paper. 16&17 OMITTED 17-A ANGLE - DILL His eyes popping with excitement. STEPHANIE They wanted to send Boo to the asylum, but his daddy said no Radley was going to any asylum, so they locked him up in the basement of the Courthouse till he almost died of the damp and then his daddy brought him back home. And there he is to this day, sittin’ in there with his scissors, lord knows what he’s doin’ or thinkin’. Maudie calls to her MAUDIE Hello, Stephanie. STEPHANIE Hello, Maudie (starts toward Miss Maudie Now children, run over and play in your own yard. Dill starts across the street followed by Jem and Scout. They stare at the Radley house as they GO. Suddenly Jem stops in the middle of the street, calling to the others. JEM Look. He points toward the Radley house. Dill and Scout stop. 12. DILL What is it? JEM Didn’t you see him? He was just there at the window. He points his finger toward the Radley house, Dill and Scout look and as they do, Jem raises his hand. JEM And watch out- he’s liable to come running out with his scissors and stab us all. He pretends he is stabbing them. Scout and Dill SCREAM and run OFF. DISSOLVE TO: 18 EXT. FINCH YARD - MOVING SHOT - SCOUT, JEM, DILL It’s almost five o’clock in the afternoon. They are playing Follow-the-Leader. Jem is leading. He, at this moment, is turning hand-springs and Scout is following. Dill is half-attempting to follow but is not able to execute them. Jem then runs for the tree house, climbs up, stand for a beat and starts down as Scout starts to tackle the tree. Jem runs for the front sidewalk, Scout behind him, Dill behind her, having avoided climbing the tree. In the distance, we HEAR the town clock strike five. JEM It’s five o’clock. He starts to run out of the yard. DILL Where you going? SCOUT Time to meet Atticus. She runs after Jem; Dill follows after her. DILL Why do you call your daddy Atticus? SCOUT ‘Cause Jem does. DILL Why does he? 13. SCOUT I don’t know. He just started to when he first began talking. 19 EXT. SIDEWALK - MOVING SHOT They run up the street, south, towards town. Jem slows down. JEM Mrs. Dubose is on her porch.

(MORE) I see your daddy and a colored man. The colored man looks to me like he’s crying. Wonder what he’s done to cry about. Dill gets so absorbed in watching he stops talking. Scout and Jem begin to feel the strain of holding him up. SCOUT What’s going on? DILL There are a lot of men sitting together on one side and one man keeps pointing and yelling at the colored man. They’re taking the colored man away. JEM Where is Atticus? DILL I can’t see your daddy now, either.

JEM (whispering Now don’t make a sound. 38. 63 MOVING SHOT The children cautiously approach the house.

RADLEY BACK YARD AND BACK PORCH The back yard is even less inviting than the front. A ramshackle porch runs the width of the house. There are two doors and two dark windows between the doors. Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supports one end of the porch. Above it a hat rack catches the moon and shines eerily.

He stands still, then tries his weight by degrees. The step is SILENT. Jem skips two steps, puts his foot on the porch, heaves himself to it, and teeters a long moment. He regains his balance and drops on his knees. He crawls to the window, raises his head and looks in. Scout suddenly looks up and sees a shadow... it is the shadow of a man. The back porch is bathed in moonlight and the shadow, crisp as toast, moves across the porch toward Jem. Dill sees it next. He puts his hands to his face The shadow crosses Jem. Jem sees it, he puts his arms over his head and goes rigid. The shadow stops about a foot beyond Jem. Its arms come out from its side, drop and are still. Then it turns and moves back across Jem, walks along the porch and off the side of the house, returning as it had come. Jem leaps off the porch and gallops toward Scout and Dill. He flings open the gate and pushes Dill and Scout through, pushing them through the collards. Scout trips. As she trips -- JEM Our back yard... Hurry, Scout. 68 EXT.

You want to have it all wrinkled before you even get to school? Miss Maudie straightens Scout’s skirt. SCOUT I still don’t see why I have to ear a darn old dress. MAUDIE You’ll get used to it. 45. Scout sits at the table and starts to eat. Jem has eaten his breakfast, all he’s going to, and gets up. JEM I’m ready. ATTICUS Son, it’s a half hour before school starts. Now wait for your sister. JEM Hurry up, Scout. SCOUT I’m trying to. She takes a few half-hearted bites, then she gets up. SCOUT I’m ready. JEM Come on. Jem starts out, Scout follows him. Miss Maudie, Atticus and Calpurnia go as far as the screen door with them. Scout and Jem go out the screen door. 82 GROUP SHOT - ATTICUS, CALPURNIA, MISS MAUDIE They stand watching the children. CALPURNIA Well, there she goes. My Lord, Mr. Finch weren’t no more’n yesterday I was rocking Scout good night.

MISS CAROLINE Do you know the answer to my questing? SCOUT Yes’m, I know. (takes a deep breath and looks up at her Most of them have been in first grade before because they’re from the country and have to quit school early to help their daddies chop their cotton. 47. MISS CAROLINE (after a pause Have you ever been in the first grade before? SCOUT No’m. MISS CAROLINE Well, then, I’ll start with you.

Walter has no shoes on, but he is wearing a clean shirt and some neatly mended overalls. He doesn’t answer Miss Caroline’s question. He looks straight ahead, a muscle jumps in his strong jaw. MISS CAROLINE Did you forget it this morning? Walter’s jaw twitches again. WALTER Yes’m. She reaches in the pocket of her dress, gets a change purse, and takes out a quarter. MISS CAROLINE Here’s a quarter. Go and eat downtown today. You can pay me back tomorrow. WALTER No, thank you, ma’m. There is whispering in the classroom. Miss Caroline, hearing it, turns around. 49.

Miss Caroline walks over to Scout. MISS CAROLINE Jean Louise, what were you all whispering about? SCOUT (reluctantly That boy’s a Cunningham, teacher. The Cunninghams never took anything they can’t pay back. No church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody. Miss Caroline descends on Scout, interrupting her. MISS CAROLINE Jean Louise, I’ve had about enough of you. I warn you to watch your step. Now -- O.S. SOUND: SCHOOL BELL MISS CAROLINE All right, children, you are dismissed. The children go tearing out of the classroom. Scout follows them. 90 EXT. SCHOOL YARD Scout sees Walter Cunningham standing in the school yard. She grabs him, throws him down and begins to rub his nose in the dirt. Jem comes running up and pulls her off. JEM Cut that out, Scout. What do you think you’re doing? You’re biggern’ he is. SCOUT He’s almost as old as you. Besides, he made me start off on the wrong foot. I was tryin’ to explain to that damn lady teacher why he didn’t have no money for his lunch and she got sore at me. 50. Walter has picked himself up and stand with his fists half-cocked. Jem looks him over. JEM Your daddy Mr. Walter Cunningham from Old Sarum? Walter nods his head “yes.” JEM Come on home and have dinner with us, Walter. We’d be glad to have you.

There are string beans, roast, cornbread, turnips and rice. Walter looks at Atticus. 51. WALTER Yes, sir. I don’t know when I’ve had roast. We’ve been having lots of squirrels and rabbits lately. My pa and I go hunting in our spare time. JEM You got a gun of your own? WALTER Uh huh. JEM How long you had a gun? WALTER A year or so. (he looks at Atticus) Can I have the syrup, please? ATTICUS Yes, certainly, son. (calling Calpurnia Cal, will you please bring the syrup dish? CALPURNIA (O.S.) Yes, sir. JEM Atticus, how old were you when you got your first gun? ATTICUS Thirteen of fourteen. 93 ANGLE - FAVORING ATTICUS ATTICUS I remember when my daddy gave me the gun, he told me: “Never point at anything in the house,: and that he’d rather I’d just shoot tin cans in the back yard. But he said sooner or later, he supposed, the temptation to go after birds would be too much and to shoot all the blue jays I wanted if I could hit them; but to remember, it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. JEM Why? 52. ATTICUS Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don’t do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat people’s gardens, they don’t nest in corncribs, they don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. Anyway, that’s why I think it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird. (to Scout How did you like school, Scout? SCOUT (noncommittally All right. Calpurnia COMES INTO the dining room with the syrup dish. ATTICUS Walter would like it, please, Cal. Calpurnia takes the syrup dish to him and he begins to pur it liberally all over his food. 94 ANGLE - SCOUT She is watching this process. She makes a face of disgust. SCOUT What in the Sam Hill are you doing, Walter? The silver saucer clatters as he places the pitcher on it and he quickly puts his hands in his lap and ducks his head.

CALPURNIA (she is furious You march in that kitchen. I want to talk to you. 53. Scout eyes her suspiciously, sees she is in no mood to be trifled with, and goes out to the kitchen. Calpurnia stalks after her. 95 INT. KITCHEN Scout ENTERS, followed by Calpurnia. CALPURNIA There’s some folks who don’t eat like us, but you ain’t called on to contradict them at the table when they don’t. That boy’s yo’ comp’ny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth, you let him, you hear? An’ if you can’t act fit to eat at the table, you can just set here an’ eat in the kitchen. Calpurnia sends her through the dining room door with a smack. 96 INT. DINING ROOM Scout, much humbled, COMES IN. She keeps her eyes down and gets her plate and goes BACK OUT to the kitchen. Neither Jem, Walter nor Atticus notice her. 97 INT. KITCHEN Calpurnia is still glowering when Scout COMES IN. Scout shoots her a dirty look. She puts her plate on the table and starts to eat. She is furious. SCOUT (taking all her frustration about school out on Calpurnia You wait, you mean old Calpurnia. I’m going to fix you. One of these days when you aren’t lookin’, I’ll go off and drown myself in the Baker’s Eddy and they you’ll be sorry. Jem and Walter come INTO the kitchen and go toward the screen door.

Scout turns to her father to explain, takes on look at him and bursts out crying again. ATTICUS Now, now, now. He takes her in his arms. 55. 101 MED. SHOT - SCOUT, ATTICUS Scout wipes her eyes. SCOUT Atticus, I’m not going back to school any more. ATTICUS Now, Scout, it’s just the first day. 102 CLOSE SHOT - SCOUT, ATTICUS SCOUT I don’t care. Everything went wrong. My teacher got mad as the devil at me and said you were teaching me to read all wrong and to stop it. And then she acts like a fool and tries to give Walter Cunningham a quarter when everybody knows Cunningham’s won’t take nothin’ from nobody. Any fool could have told her that. ATTICUS Now, Scout. Maybe she’s just nervous. It’s her first day teaching school, and being new here. SCOUT Oh, Atticus. 103 ANGLE - FAVORING ATTICUS ATTICUS Now wait a minute. If you can learn a single trick, Scout, you’ll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. SCOUT Sir? ATTICUS Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it. 56. SCOUT But if I keep going to school we can’t ever read any more. ATTICUS Do you know what a compromise is? 104 ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING SCOUT As she considers his question. SCOUT Bending the law? ATTICUS No...an agreement reached by mutual consent. It works this way: if you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll read the same every night, just as we always have. It that a bargain? SCOUT Yes, sir. ATTICUS All right. Now hurry back to school or you’ll be late. ANGLE WIDENS as she starts on. ATTICUS Scout -- She pauses. ATTICUS By the way, Scout, you’d better not say anything at school about our agreement. SCOUT Why not? ATTICUS I have a feeling that if you tell Miss Caroline that we read every night, she’ll get after me, and I wouldn’t want her after me. SCOUT Yes, sir. 57. She goes out of the yard. Atticus watches her go. DISSOLVE TO: 105 EXT. THE FINCH GARAGE - NIGHT Atticus backs the car out. It is an old car, not very well kept. Scout and Jem come running toward him.

THE STREET - THEIR POINT OF VIEW They SEE the dog, not much more than a speck in the distance, walking erratically, as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs. 71. SCOUT He looks like a car stuck in a sand bed. JEM He’s gone lopsided. 147 REVERSE ANGLE - MOVING SHOT Calpurnia grabs the children by their shoulders and starts running home. DISSOLVE TO: 148 INT. KITCHEN Calpurnia and the children RUN IN. She goes to the telephone, SHOUTING in her excitement, but first, she closes the outside door.

The mockingbirds are silent. There is a total stillness. Heck Tate sniffs, and then blows his nose. He shifts the gun to the crook of his arm. ATTICUS (softly There he is. They see Tim Johnson COME INTO SIGHT, walking dazedly in the inner rim of a curve parallel to the Radley place. TATE He’s got it all right, Mr. Finch. Tim Johnson is still advancing at a snail’s pace. He seems dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that inches him towards the Finch’s. He reaches the street which runs in front of the Radley place. He pauses as if with what is left of his poor mind he is trying to consider what road to take. He makes a few hesitant steps, reaches the Radley gate, tries to turn around but is having difficulty. 152 BACK TO SCENE - ATTICUS, CALPURNIA, HECK TATE - ON BACK PORCH ATTICUS He’s within range, Heck. Go inside, Cal. 73. Calpurnia opens the screen door, latches it behind her, then unlatches it and holds on to the hook. Jem and Scout peer out from under her arms. TATE Take him, Mr. Finch. He hand the rifle to Atticus. SCOUT (in terror for her father Oh, no, Mr. Tate. He don’t know how to shoot. ATTICUS (shaking his head vehemently Don’t waste time, Heck. TATE For God’s sake, Mr. Finch, he’s got to be killed right away before he starts running. Look where he is. I can’t shoot that well and you know it. ATTICUS I haven’t shot a gun in twenty years. Heck Tate almost throws the gun at Atticus. TATE I’d feel mighty comfortable if you did now. Atticus accepts the gun and walks OFF the porch. 153 EXT. THE YARD - MOVING SHOT Atticus WALKS OUT of the yard and to the middle of the street. He raises his glasses, pushes them to his forehead They slip down and he drops them in the street. In the silence, we can hear them CRACK. Atticus, blinking hard, rubs his eyes and his chin. 154 EXT. THE STREET AND TIM JOHNSON - ATTICUS’ POINT OF VIEW Tim Johnson has made up his mind. He takes two steps forward, stops, raises his head. The dog’s body goes rigid. 74. 155 BACK TO SCENE - ATTICUS IN STREET His hand yanks a ball-tipped lever as he brings the gun to his shoulder. The RIFLE CRACKS. Tim Johnson leaps, flops over, and crumples on the sidewalk. 156 EXT. THE BACK PORCH Heck Tate jumps off the porch and runs toward the Radleys. 157 EXT. THE STREET Atticus stoops, picks up his glasses and grinds the broken lens to powder, and walks toward the dog. 158 EXT. BACK PORCH Jem and Scout are dumbfounded. Scout regains her senses first and pinches Jem to get him moving. They run OUT of the door. 159 EXT. THE STREET Heck Tate and Atticus are walking toward the house. They meet the still awestruck Scout and Jem. The children APPROACH Atticus reverently. ATTICUS Don’t you go near that dog, you understand? He’s just as dangerous dead as alive. JEM Yes, sir. Atticus -- ATTICUS What, son? JEM Nothin’. TATE (grinning What’s the matter, boy? Can’t you talk? Didn’t you know your daddy was the best shot in this county? ATTICUS Hush, Heck.

He and atticus get in the car and drive OFF. Jem and Scout, still stunned, stand watching them go. JEM Come on, Scout. I got some money for my birthday and let’s go downtown and I’ll treat you to anything you want. Come on. 160 EXT. SIDEWALK - MOVING SHOT Scout and Jem are running. They come to Mrs. Dubose’s. Jem starts to sprint, Scout after him. Just as they reach her gate, Jessie wheels her vigorously ONTO her porch, and she spots the children, SCREAMING: MRS. DUBOSE I guess you’re proud of your father now. JEM Yes’m. Jem stops and faces her. Scout pulls at him to continue on. MRS. DUBOSE Why are you so proud of him? JEM (shouting back defiantly Because he’s brave and because he’s the best shot in Maycomb County and because -- MRS. DUBOSE Why are you so proud of that? Nobody else is proud of him.

Their good spirits have all been deflated. 161 CLOSE MOVING SHOT - JEM AND SCOUT They continue on down the sidewalk. SCOUT (anxiously Don’t contradict her no more, Jem. Jem doesn’t answer her. Scout follows silently after him. Suddenly, Jem grabs a stick and runs, flailing wildly, up the steps into Mrs. Dubose’s front yard. SCOUT (SCREAMING Don’t Jem. She’ll kill you. Jem, she has that pistol, you know, that -- With great violence, Jem takes the stick and cuts off the tops of every camellia bush in the yard. The yard is littered with green buds and leaves. There is a SCREAM from Mrs. Dubose as she sees what is happening. JEM (SCREAMING I hate you, Mrs. Dubose. I hate you, I hate you. DISSOLVE TO: 162 INT.

He seems extremely tired and very saddened. 77. He stands for a moment in the yard looking at the wreckage and then stoops down and picks up a broken camellia bud and the stick and starts walking slowly and thoughtfully home. 164 INT. FINCH LIVING ROOM The children are still a the window. They hear the front door slam. O.S. SOUND - DOOR SLAM They brace themselves for an explosion, and when there is none, and Atticus doesn’t even appear, Jem looks at Scout and by some silent understanding, they decide to go find him, and they go OUT of the room. 165 INT. ATTICUS’ ROOM He is sitting on the bed, the flowers and the stick beside him. He looks up and sees the children. He points to the flowers and the stick. ATTICUS Jem, are you responsible for this? JEM Yes, sir. She said terrible things about your defending Tom Robinson. She said... ATTICUS (interrupting I don’t care what she said. I never thought you would be the one I’d have to worry about losing his head over this. To do something like this to a sick, old lady is inexcusable. Go down and have a talk with Mrs. Dubose. Come straight home afterward. Jem does not move. ATTICUS Go on, I said. Jem starts OUT of Atticus’ room. Scout follows after him. ATTICUS Come back here. 78. Scout comes back. DISSOLVE TO: 166 INT. FINCH LIVING ROOM Atticus and Scout are there. Jem comes IN. He seems very subdued. Atticus looks up at him. 167 ANGLE ON JEM He stares at the rug while talking. JEM I told her I was sorry, but I ain’t. (a pause Atticus, she wants me to read to her. She wants me to come very afternoon after school and Saturday and read to her out loud for tow hours? Atticus, do I have to? ATTICUS Certainly. JEM But she wants me to do it for a month. ATTICUS They you’ll do it for a month, Jem. DISSOLVE TO: 168 INT. MRS. DUBOSE’S HALLWAY Jem and Scout ENTER. Jem is carrying a copy of “Ivanhoe.” He KNOCKS on the second door on the left. Jessie opens a wooden door and unlatches a screen door. She peers out at them. JESSIE Who told you to bring your sister, Jem Finch? MRS. DUBOSE (O.S.) Let ‘em both in, Jessie. 79. 169 INT. MRS. DUBOSE’S ROOM In the corner of the room is a brass bed, and in the bed is Mrs. Dubose. There is a marble-topped washstand by her bed, and on the washstand is a glass with a teaspoon in it, a red ear syringe, a box of absorbent cotton, and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs. Mrs. Dubose glares at the children as they ENTER. MRS. DUBOSE So you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you? JEM (quietly My sister ain’t dirty and I ain’t scared of you. She glares at them, but doesn’t continue with a tirade. MRS. DUBOSE You may commence reading, Jeremy. Jem sits down on a cane bottom chair and opens “Ivanhoe.” Scout pulls up another chair like it. MRS. DUBOSE Come closer. Come to this side of the bed. 170 ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING MRS. DUBOSE The two children move their chairs. They are close to Mrs. Dubose. She is horrible. Her face is the color of a dirty pillowcase, the corners of her mouth glisten with wet, which inches like glaciers down the deep grooves of her chin. Old age liver spots dot her cheeks, her pale eyes have black pinpoint pupils. Her hands are knobby and the cuticles are grown up over her fingernails. Her bottom plate is not in, and her upper lip protrudes. From time to time she moves the nether lip to her upper plate and this makes the wet move faster. MRS. DUBOSE What time does it say on the clock? JEM (looking at the clock A quarter to three. MRS. DUBOSE Proceed, Jeremy. Jem begins reading. 80. JEM Ivanhoe. Chapter One. “thus communed these while to their lowly dome, the full-fed swine return’d with evening home, compell’d -- to the -- MRS. DUBOSE You skipped a word there, you numbskull.

DUBOSE’S ROOM The clock says 3:25. Jem is reading. 172 ANOTHER ANGLE - MRS. DUBOSE She lays back on the bed, the quilts up to her chin, only her head and shoulders are visible. Her head begins to move slowly from side to side. She begins from time to time to open her mouth wide, and her tongue undulates faintly, cords of saliva collect on her lips, she draws them in, then opens her mouth again. Her mouth seems to have a private existence of its own. It works separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at low tide. Occasionally, it says ‘pt.,” like some vicious substance coming to a boil. Scout pulls at Jem’s sleeve. He looks up at Scout and then at the bed. Her hand makes its regular sweep towards them. JEM Mrs. Dubose, are you all right? She doesn’t hear him. The alarm clock goes off, making a loud, tinny ring. The children almost jump out of their skins. Jessie come hurrying IN. JESSIE Shoo. You all run home now. It’s 3:30, time for her medicine. 81. The children go OUT of the room. DISSOLVE TO: 173 INT. MRS. DUBOSE’S ROOM The children are there, close to her bed, Jem is still reading “I JEM “On the lower step of the throne the Champion was made to kneel down. Indeed this whole action, since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have been upon the --” There is a KNOCK on the door. MRS. DUBOSE (SCREAMING Come in. Atticus come INTO the room. ATTICUS I was coming home from the office and didn’t see the children. I thought they might be here. He goes over to the bed and takes Mrs. Dubose’s hand. She smiles at him. MRS. DUBOSE Do you know what time it is, Atticus? Exactly fourteen minutes past five. Today the alarm clock is set for five thirty, I want you to know that. SCOUT Why do you set that alarm clock for a different time every day, Mrs. Dubose? You keep setting it later and later. Atticus puts his hand on her head. ATTICUS I have a feeling Jem’s days are numbered, Mrs. Dubose. MRS. DUBOSE Only a week longer, I think. Just to make sure. 82. Jem gets out of his chair. JEM But -- Atticus puts out his hand and Jem remains silent. Mrs. Dubose settles back on her pillow. She seems very withdrawn. ATTICUS Come on, children. Good night, Mrs. Dubose. She doesn’t answer. He starts OUT, FOLLOWED by the children. 174 INT. MRS. DUBOSE’S ROOM Jem and Scout are there. 175 ANGLE - MRS. DUBOSE She seems very alert. JEM (reading “The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity and in-- MRS. DUBOSE (interrupting That’ll do. Jem closes the book. MRS. DUBOSE It’s six thirty. Tell your father that. They rise to go. MRS. DUBOSE And that’s all. You needn’t come back any more. Good day to you. Jem and Scout go OUT of the room. 176 EXT. MRS. DUBOSE’S YARD - TWILIGHT JEM I am free. I am free. 83. He gives a “WHOOP” and Scout gives a “WHOOP.” They start running ut of the yard, laughing and yelling. Jessie comes onto the porch. She is very excited. JESSIE (calling Jem Finch. Jem Finch. Jem and Scout hear her and stop. JEM Yes? JESSIE Would you run home fast as you as you can and ask your father to come here, please? JEM Yes. He senses Jessie’s panic and tears out of the yard, Scout behind him. DISSOLVE TO: 177 INT. FINCH LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Jem and Scout are there reading. Atticus COMES IN. ATTICUS Mrs. Dubose is dead, children. They look at him. ATTICUS She’s better off. She’s not suffering any more (a pause Your punishment, Jem, served a larger purpose than any of us intended. 178 CLOSE SHOT - ATTICUS, JEM, SCOUT ATTICUS Mrs. Dubose took morphine as a pain killer for years. The doctor put her on it because she had arthritis. She’d have spent the rest of her life on it and died without suffering, but she was too contrary. 84. (MORE) She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody. She meant to break herself of it before she died, and that’s what she did while you were reading to her. JEM Yessir. ATTICUS I’m glad you got to see what real courage is, son. JEM Yessir. Jem GOES to the window and looks out. Scout joins him. Atticus goes to them and puts his arms around them. DISSOLVE TO: 179 EXT. FINCH FRONT PORCH AND STEPS - LATE AFTERNOON Atticus is on the porch half-reading his paper, half watching Scout and Jem in the yard. Jem has a baseball and a glove. Scout is watching something on the sidewalk. CAMERA PULLS IN TO CLOSE SHOT of a pill bug lying on the sidewalk. Scout’s hand reaches into the frame and is about to smash the pill bug when we hear Jem’s voice yell: JEM’S VOICE Don’t do that, Scout. Scout’s hand stops as the ANGLE WIDENS to show Jem and Scout looking at each other and Atticus watching the scene from the porch. JEM Put that bug in the grass. SCOUT Are you crazy, Jem? JEM I said put him in the grass. Scout sigh, picks up the small bug and puts it in the grass. SCOUT Why can’t I just mash him? 85. ATTICUS (CONT'D) JEM Because they don’t bother you. SCOUT (with disgust I reckon you’re at the stage now where you don’t kill flies and mosquitoes. JEM Aw, dry up. The Sheriff’s car comes by. SCOUT There’s Sheriff Tate (calling out Hey, Sheriff Tate!

The Sheriff thought he would be safer there. They;re bringing him back here tonight because his trial is tomorrow. He gets up and GOES INTO the house. From under the house Jem and Scout here the SOUND of “Psst.” They look at each other, HEAR “Psst” again. They look under the house and see Dill there, hiding. JEM God A’mighty. Scout and Jem gather around Dill. They watch him in speechless wonder. 86. 180 GROUP SHOT - DILL, JEM, SCOUT DILL It’s a wonder my hair’s not white, what I’ve been through. Did my Aunt tell you my mama married again? JEM No. 181 ANGLE - DILL DILL Well, she did, and he took a dislike to me, bound me in chains and left me to die in the basement of our house. I would have starved except for a farmer -- JEM (interrupting Dill, how did you get here? DILL I took thirteen dollars out of my mother’s purse. I caught the nine o’clock from Meridian and I got off at ... Atticus comes into the yard. Dill looks up at him and he looks at Dill. Dill starts to scurry back under the porch. ATTICUS (surprised Dill! Dill turns. He realizes he has been caught. He comes back toward Atticus. DILL Mr. Finch, don’t tell my Aunt Stephanie I’m here, please, sir. Don’t make me go back. I’ll run off again. ATTICUS Whoa, son. Nobody’s gonna make you do anything but go to bed pretty soon. I’m just going to call Stephanie and ask her if you can’t spend the night here. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? 87. DILL Yes, sir. Atticus leaves. DISSOLVE TO: 182 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT The children are listening to Kate Smith on the radio. Atticus is reading his paper. There’s a KNOCK at the front screen door. Atticus goes and sees Heck Tate standing there. ATTICUS Even’, Heck. Come in. Tate comes inside. TATE Mr. Finch, news has gotten around the County about my bringin’ Tom Robinson back to the jail, and I’ve heard there might be trouble from the Cunninghams and that bunch out at Old Sarum. ATTICUS Oh. He goes to the radio and turns it down. ATTICUS Jem, you and Scout and Dill run to your room and play. I have to talk to the Sheriff. JEM Yessir. He starts OUT. Scout and Dill follow after him. Atticus goes over to Tate. ATTICUS Have a seat, Heck. TATE Nosir, I won’t take the time. Mr. Link Deas and some of the other prominent citizens around town heard about the Old Sarum bunch too and they asked me to come to you to see if we can’t hold up the trial for awhile. 88. ATTICUS Heck, we’ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure there’s nothin’ to be uneasy about. You can keep Tom one night, can’t you? I don’t think anybody in Maycomb’ll begrudge me a client with times this hard. TATE Nobody around here is up to anything, Mr. Finch. It’s just that Old Sarum bunch we’re worried about. You know how they are when they get stirred up. That’s why the men here in town think you should ask for another postponement. Mr. Link Deas even feels we should take him back to the Abbottsville jail tonight. ATTICUS I’m sure. According to Link Deas, I shouldn’t have taken this case in the first place. Heck, you know the people here in town, or the people out in Old Sarum wouldn’t be upset if they didn’t think I really intended defending Tom Robinson. An’ Heck, that’ll never change, not if the trial is tomorrow or in six months or next year. I’m going to defend him to the best of my ability. He may go to the chair, Heck, but he’s not going until the truth is told, and you know what the truth is. There is a SOUND of children ROUGHHOUSING from the bedrooms. ATTICUS Now you better go back and tell them that. I’ve got to get my children to bed. HECK Yessir. He GOES. The NOISE from the children’s rooms continues. Atticus closes the door after him.

They see his car parked in front of the building. They look in the doorway of the building. It is dark. Jem tries the knob of the door. It is locked. JEM There’s his car. Let’s go back up the street. They walk up the sidewalk. They see a solitary light burning in the distance. It is from the jail. As they approach the jail, they can see the long extension cord Atticus brought from home running between the bars of the second-floor window and down the side of the building. In the light from its bare bulb they see Atticus propped against the front door. He is sitting on one of his office chairs and he is reading, oblivious of the night bugs hovering about his head. Scout starts to run toward him. JEM Scout. (she pauses Don’t go to him. He might not like it. He’s all right. Let’s go home. I just wanted to see where he was and what he was up to.

They run to the men and push themselves through them until they reach Atticus. SCOUT Hey, Atticus. She smiles up at him, but when she catches the look of fear on his face, she becomes insecure. Scout looks around a the men surrounding her. These are strangers to her, country men, not the men she saw on her porch. Atticus gets up from his chair and begins to move slowly, like an old man, toward them. 195 GROUP SHOT - ATTICUS - JEM - SCOUT - DILL ATTICUS Go home, Jem. Take Scout and Dill home. Scout looks up at Jem. She sees he is not thinking of leaving. ATTICUS Go home, I said. Jem shakes his head “no”.

A burly man grabs Jem roughly by the collar. MAN I’ll send him home. The burly man almost yanks Jem off his feet. Atticus flushes. His fists clench. He reaches for Jem, but before he gets him Scout kicks the man swiftly. SCOUT Don’t you touch him. The man falls back in pain. Atticus puts his hand on her shoulder. ATTICUS That’ll do, Scout.

Walter Cunningham does not seem to hear her. SCOUT I said, hey, Mr. Cunningham. How’s your entailment gettin’ along? The big man blinks and hooks his thumbs into his overall straps. He seems uncomfortable. He clears his throat and looks away. Scout walks a little closer to him. SCOUT Don’t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I’m Jean Louise Finch. You brought us some hickory nuts one early morning, remember? We had a talk. I went and got my daddy to come out to tank you. I go to school with your boy. I go to school with Walter. He’s a nice boy. Tell him “hey” for me, won’t you? You know something, Mr. Cunningham, entailments are bad. Entailments - -- Suddenly, Scout realizes she is the center of everyone’s attention: the men, her brother, Dill, Atticus. She becomes self conscious. She turns to Atticus. SCOUT Atticus, I was just sayin’ to Mr. Cunningham that entailments are bad, but not to worry, it takes a long time sometimes. She begins to dry up. She looks up at the country men staring at her. They are quite still. SCOUT What’s the matter? She looks at Atticus. He says nothing. She looks back at Mr. Cunningham. SCOUT I sure meant no harm, Mr. Cunningham. CUNNINGHAM No harm taken, young lady. 96. 198 CLOSE SHOT - CUNNINGHAM - SCOUT, JEM Mr. Cunningham moves forward and takes Scout by the shoulders.

It is like Saturday. Wagons carrying country people on the way to the trial stream past the house. Some men ride horseback. Scout, Jem and Dill sit on the curb of the sidewalk watching the wagons and the horses go by. SCOUT Did you ever see so many people. It’s Jus’ like Saturday. A man rides by on a mule and waves to the children, and they wave back. A wagon-load of ladies rides past. They wear cotton sun bonnets and dresses with long sleeves. A bearded man in a wool hat drives by next. Jem suddenly gets up. SCOUT Where are you going? JEM I can’t stand it any longer. I’m going down to the courthouse to watch. SCOUT You better not. You know Atticus told us to keep away from there. JEM I don’t care if he did. I’m not going to miss the most exciting thing that ever happened in this town. He starts on. Scout and Dill look at each other and start to follow him. DISSOLVE TO: 202 EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE It is deserted, as everyone is inside watching the trial. Scout, Jem and Dill come into the yard. They stand looking up at the courthouse. JEM Come on. They all start towards the entrance. 98. 203 INT. COURTHOUSE - STAIRS AND UPPER HALL Scout, Jem and Dill go up the stairs towards the entrance. When they get to the entrance, Jem peeks through the hole of the door. He looks back at the other two. JEM It’s packed solid. They’re standing all along the back. REVEREND SYKES, the Negro Baptist preacher, comes up the stairs. Jem and the children go over to him. JEM Reverend Sykes, you going upstairs? SYKES Yes, I am. JEM Could we go with you? Every seat is taken down here and they’re standing all along the back. SYKES Why, I guess so. Come on. He starts up the stairs and they follow after him. 204 INT. COLORED BALCONY Rev. Sykes ENTERS with Jem, Dill and Scout. He leads them gently into and among the black people in the gallery. Four Negroes in the front row get up and give them their seats when they see them come in. They sit down and peer over the balcony. The colored balcony runs along three walls of the courtroom like a second-story veranda, and from it the children see everything. 205 INT. COURTROOM - CHILDREN’S POINT OF VIEW The jury sits to the left under long windows. Sunburned, lanky, they are nearly all farmers, but this is only natural. Town folk rarely sit on juries, they are either struck or excused. The Circuit Solicitor and another man, Atticus and Tom Robinson, sit at tables with their backs to the children. Just inside the railing which divides the spectators from the Court, the witnesses sit on cowhide-bottomed chairs, their backs also to the children. Judge Taylor is on the bench, looking like a sleepy, old shark. 99. 206 BACK TO - GROUP SHOT - JEM, SCOUT, DILL, SCOUT (pointing down to courtroom Jem, are those the Ewells sittin’ down yonder? JEM (whispering Hush. Mr. Heck Tate’s testifyin’. 207 INT. COURTROOM The Solicitor, MR. GILMER, is cross-examining Heck Tate. TATE On the night of August 21st I was just leaving my office to go home when Bob -- Mr. Ewell -- came in. Very excited he was, and said to get to his house quick, that his girl had been raped. 208 CLOSE SHOT - HECK TATE TATE I got in my car and went out there as fast as I could. She was pretty well beat up. I asked her if Tom Robinson beat her like that, she said yes, he had. Asked her if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did. So I went down to the Robinson’s house and brought him back. She identified him as the one, so I took him in. That’s all there was to it. GILMER Thank you. ANGLE WIDENS, as Judge Taylor turns to Atticus. JUDGE Any questions, Atticus? ATTICUS Yes. He is sitting behind his table, his chair skewed to one side, his legs crossed, and one arm is resting on the back of his chair. 100. ATTICUS Did anybody call a doctor, Sheriff? TATE No, sir. ATTICUS Why not? TATE ‘Cause I didn’t think it was necessary. She was beat up. Somethin’ sho happened, it was obvious. ATTICUS Sheriff, you say she was mighty beat up. In what way? TATE Well, she was beaten around the head. There were already bruises comin’ on her arms. She had a black eye startin’... ATTICUS Which eye? TATE Let’s see -- Heck Tate blinks and runs his hand through his hair. He points to an invisible person five inches in front of him. TATE Her left. ATTICUS Was it her left facin’ you, or her left looking the same way you were? TATE Oh, yes, that’d make it her right. It was her right eye, Mr. Finch. I remember now, she was beat up on that side of her face. Heck Tate blinks again and then turns and looks at Tom Robinson as if something has been made clear to him at the same time. Tom Robinson raises his head. Something has been made clear to Atticus, too, and he gets to his feet. He walks toward Heck Tate. 101. 209 TWO SHOT - ATTICUS, TATE ATTICUS Which side again, Heck? TATE The right side. And her arms were bruised and she showed me her neck. There were definite finger marks on her gullet. ATTICUS All around her throat? At the back of her neck? TATE I’d say they were all around. Atticus nods to Mr. Gilmer as he sits down. Mr. Gilmer shakes his head at the Judge. The Judge nods to Heck Tate, who rises stiffly and steps down from the witness stand. 210 FULL SHOT - WHITE SPECTATORS ON FIRST FLOOR Feet are scraped, babies are shifted to shoulders, and a few children scamper OUT of the courtroom. 211 FULL SHOT - COLORED SPECTATORS IN BALCONY The Negroes whisper softly amongst themselves. 212 ANGLE ON DILL AND REV. SYKES DILL Reverend, what was that all about? SYKES I’m jus’ not sure, son. 213 ANGLE ON JEM AND SCOUT Jem is leaning over the railing. 214 INT. COURTROOM - JEM’S POINT OF VIEW The Clerk booms out: CLERK Robert E. Lee Ewell. 102. Robert E. Lee Ewell rises and struts to the stand.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT, as the rest of the testimony is DROWNED OUT by the people in the courtroom, who begin to MURMUR with excitement. Judge Taylor begins to BANG his desk with his gavel. Heck Tate goes to the aisle, trying to quiet the crowd. Atticus is on his feet whispering to the Judge. 217 INT. COLORED BALCONY - GROUP SHOT - REV. SYKES, JEM, DILL, SCOUT Behind them the Negroes are giving angry, muffled GROANS. SYKES Jem, you better take your sister home, you hear me? JEM I think it’s okay, Reverend, she doesn’t understand it.

SCOUT Jem -- JEM Shh, I want to hear what’s going on. 218 INT. COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - ANGLE ON BOB EWELL Mr. Gilmer is still questioning Ewell. The spectators have quieted. GILMER What did you do when you saw the defendant? EWELL Well, I run around the house to get in, but he ran out the front door just ahead of me. I sawed who it was, all right. I run in the house and po’ Mayella was lyin’ on the floor quallin’, then I run for Mr. Tate quick as I could. GILMER Thank you, Mr. Ewell. Mr. Gilmer sits down.

I seen what happened. ATTICUS (casually Mr. Ewell, you heard the Sheriff’s testimony. Do you agree with his description of Mayella’s injuries? EWELL I hold with everything Tate said. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up. 104. JEM (CONT'D) ATTICUS Mr. Ewell, can you read and write? EWELL Yes, sir. ATTICUS Will you write your name and show us? Atticus takes paper and pen out of his coat. He hand them to Ewell. ANGLE WIDENS to SHOW the Judge and Mr. Gilmer watching. Ewell looks up and sees their attention. EWELL What’s so interesting’? JUDGE You’re left-handed, Mr. Ewell. Ewell turns angrily to the Judge. ",

A silence comes over the court as MAYELLA EWELL, a young girl, walks to the witness stand. She raises her right hand and swears to tell the truth, the whole truth. She is a thick bodied girl, accustomed to strenuous labor. Mr. Gilmer raises and begins to question her. 222 ANGLE ON MAYELLA GILMER Now, Miss Mayella, you just tell us what happened. Mayella stares at him and then burst into tears. 223 CLOSE SHOT - MAYELLLA MAYELLA Well, sir, I was on the porch and - - and he came along and, you see, there was this old chiffarobe in the yard. I said, “Come here, boy, and bust up this chiffarobe and I’ll give you a nickel.” So he came in the yard and I go in the house to get him the nickel, and I turn around and ‘fore I know it, he was on me. I fought’n hollered but he had me around the neck. He hit me again and again. Next thing I knew, Papa was in the room a -standin’ over me hollerin’ :Who done it, who done it?” ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE Mr. Gilmer and the Judge. GILMER Thank you. Your witness, Atticus. Gilmer walks away. Atticus gets up grinning. He opens his coat, hooks his thumbs in his vest, walks slowly across the room to the windows. ATTICUS (smiling at her) Miss Mayella, how old are you? MAYELLA (sullenly Won’t answer a word you say, long as you keep mockin’ me. ATTICUS Ma’m? 106. MAYELLA Long as you keep makin’ fun of me. JUDGE $gently Mr. Finch is not making fun of you. What is the matter with you? MAYLELLA Then why does he call me “Miss Mayella’ and “Ma’m? JUDGE That’s just his way. He’s just trying to be polite (leans back and sighs wearily Atticus, let’s get on. ATTICUS How old are you? MAYELLA Nine teen. ATTICUS How long has your mother been dead? MAYELLA I don’t know. A long time. ATTICUS Did you ever go to school? MAYELLA Yes, sir. Two or three years.

She glares at Atticus. ATTICUS When he’s riled, has he ever beaten you? 107. Mayella looks at the Judge. JUDGE (sternly now Answer the question, Miss Mayella. MAYELLA (defiantly My Pa’s never touched a hair o’ my head in my life.

ATTICUS Thank you. Now will you identify the man who raped you. MAYELLA I will. (points to Tom) That’s him, yonder. Atticus turns. ANGLE WIDENS to include Tom Robinson, the Judge, and Mr. Gilmer. ATTICUS Tome stand up. Let Miss Mayella have a good, long look at you. Tom Robinson rises to his feet. It is our first good look at him. He is thirty. Atticus goes to the table and picks up his brief case. ATTICUS (throwing brief case Here, Tom, catch this please. Tom catches it in his right hand. Atticus takes the brief case from him. ATTICUS Now this time catch it in your left hand. TOM I can’t, sir. ATTICUS Why can’t you? TOM I can’t move my left hand at all. I got it caught in a cotton gin when I was twelve years old. All my muscles were tore loose. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT. Again the courtroom is in an uproar. 109. 225 INT. COLORED BALCONY - GROUP SHOT - JEM, SCOUT, DILL AND SYKES Jem almost falls out of the balcony with excitement. He pounds the railing. JEM Scout, Reverend, look. He’s crippled. We’ve won. We’ve won.

Your Ma’m-in’ and Miss Mayellerin’ don’t come to nothin’, Mr. Finch. ANGLE WIDENS as she burst into real tears. Her shoulders shake with angry sobs. Atticus has hit her in a way that is not clear to him, but it has given him no pleasure in doing it. He sits with his head down. GILMER The State rests, Judge. Mayella gets down out of the chair, still crying. When she passes Atticus, she glares at him with real hatred. CLERK Tom Robinson. 228 ANGLE - TOM ROBINSON Tom stand up and goes to the witness chair. When the Clerk calls out his oath, Tom can’t manage the Bible with his bad arm, though he tries twice. JUDGE That’ll do, Tom. Tom finishes the oath verbally and then sits down in the witness chair.

That was way last spring, way over a year ago. ATTICUS Did you ever go on the place again? TOM Yes, suh. ATTICUS When? TOM Well, I went lots of times. Seemed like ever time I passed by yonder she’d have some little somethin’ for me to do -- choppin’ kindlin’, totin’ water for her. ATTICUS Tom, what happened to you on the evening of August 21st of last year? 231 FULL SHOT - COURTROOM The spectators, white and black, all lean forward. It is very quiet in the room. 112. 232 CLOSE ANGLE -- TWO SHOT - TOM, ATTICUS TOM Mr. Finch, I was goin’ home as usual that evenin’, and when I passed the Ewell place, Miss Mayella were on the porch, like she said she were, an’ she says for me to come there an’ help her a minute. Well, I went inside the fence an’ looked aroun’ for some kindlin’ to work on, but I didn’t see none. An’ she said now come in the house, she has a door needs fixin’. So I follows her inside and looked at the door and I say it look all right, an’ she shut the door in my face. All the time I was wonder’ why it was so quiet like and it came to me there was not a child on the place, an’ I said, Miss Mayella, where the children? An’ she says, they all gone to town to get ice creams. She says it took her a slap year to save seb’m nickels, but she done it an’ they all gone to town. Tom’s black, velvet skin has begun to shine. He runs his hand over his face. He is obviously very uncomfortable. ATTICUS What did you say then, Tom? TOM I said somethin’ like, why, Miss Mayella, that’s right smart o’ you to treat ‘em. An’ she said, you think so? Well, I said, I best be goin’, I couldn’ do nothin’ for her, an’ she says, oh, yes, I could. An’ I ask her what, an’ she says to jus’ step on that chair yonder an’ git that box down from on top of the chiffarobe. So I done what she told me, an’ was reachin’ when the next things I knew she -- grabbed me aroun’ The legs. She scared me so bad I hopped down an’ turned the chair over. That was the only thing, only furniture ‘sturbed in the room, Mr. Finch, I swear, when I left it. 113. ATTICUS What happened after you turned the chair over? Tom comes to a dead atop. He glances at Atticus, then at the jury. ATTICUS Tom, you’ve sworn to tell the whole truth. Will you tell it? Tom runs his hand nervously over his mouth. ATTICUS What happened after that? JUDGE Answer the question 233 ANGLE - TOM TOM Mr. Finch, I got offa that chair an’ turned around an’ she sorts jumped on me. She hugged me aroun’ the waist. She reached up an’ kissed me on the face.

ANGLE WIDENS as Atticus sits down. Mr. Gilmer goes to the witness chair. GILMER (very sarcastically Robinson, you’re pretty good at bustin’ up chiffarobes and kindlin’ with one hand, aren’t you? Strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor? TOM (meekly I never done that, suh. GILMER But you’re strong enough to. TOM I reckon so, suh. GILMER Why were you so anxious to do that woman’s chores? Tom hesitates. He searches for an answer. TOM Looks like she didn’t have nobody to help her, like I says --- GILMER (with great sarcasm With Mr. Ewell and seven children on the place. You did all this choppin’ and work from sheer goodness, boy? You’re a mighty good fellow it seems. Did all this for not one penny? TOM Yes, suh.

SCOUT How long has he been at it? JEM He’s gone over all the evidence. We’re gonna win, Scout. I don’t see how we can’t. He made it plain an’ easy ... like I’d a explained it to you. 255 INT.",
" COURTROOM - CLOSE SHOT - ATTICUS ATTICUS Gentlemen, I would like to use my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one. We see the jurors from Atticus’ P.O.V. They watch with no show of emotion. These are the faces of farmer -- lined and careworn. BACK TO ATTICUS - As he talks he looks into the eyes of the men of the jury as if to find one to encourage him. ATTICUS To begin with, this case should never have come to trial. The State has not produced on iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on cross examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant. There is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left... and Tom Robinson now sits before you with the only good hand he possesses... his right hand. 117. (MORE) I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance -- but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man’s life at stake which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt. I say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time honored code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She must destroy the evidence of her offense. What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro. She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society is unspeakable: She kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong, young Negro man. No code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on her afterwards. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the Sheriff of Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this Court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted, confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption -- the evil assumption -- that all Negroes lie, that all Negroes are basically immoral beings, that all Negro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber, which, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie I do not have to point out to you. And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to “feel sorry” for a white woman has had to put his word against two white people’s. 118. ATTICUS (CONT'D) (MORE) The defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is. THE JURY - ATTICUS’ P.O.V. Their faces haven’t changed expression. One man’s chin itches, and he scratches it. One man brushes a fly off his knee. BACK TO ATTICUS His face is beginning to perspire. He wipes it with a handkerchief. ATTICUS In this country our courts are the great levelers, and in our courts all men are created equal. I’m no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury system. That is no ideal to me...It is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of God, do your duty. In the name of God, believe Tom Robinson. Atticus turns away from the jury. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT of courtroom. Calpurnia COMES INTO the courtroom. She makes her way down the middle aisle toward Atticus. She stops shyly at the railing and waits to get Judge Taylor’s attention. JUDGE Yes, Calpurnia? CALPURNIA Could I just pass this note on to Mr. Finch? It hasn’t got anything to do with the trial. Judge Taylor nods and Atticus takes the note. He reads it. ATTICUS Judge, Calpurnia says my children have been missing since noon. Could -- 119. ATTICUS (CONT'D) JUDGE (interrupting I know where they are, Atticus. They’re right up yonder in the colored balcony. Atticus turns and looks up at the balcony. He sees the children and calls: ATTICUS (sternly Jem, come down from there. Scout, Dill and Jem climb over Rev. Sykes and start out. 256 INT. COURTHOUSE - BOTTOM OF BALCONY STAIRS Atticus and Calpurnia are there. Jem comes running to his father in excitement. JEM We’ve won, haven’t we? ATTICUS (coldly I’ve no idea. You’ve been here all afternoon? Go home with Calpurnia and get your supper -- and stay home. JEM (disappointed) Aw, Atticus, let us come back. Please let us hear the verdict. Please, sir. ATTICUS (looks at Jem and sees how much he wants to be there Well, you’ve heard it all, so you might as well hear the rest. Tell you what: you all can come back when you’ve eaten your supper. But I expect it’ll be over before you get back. JEM (eagerly) You think they’ll acquit him that fast? 120. Atticus opens his mouth to answer but shuts it and leaves them. Calpurnia and the children leave. DISSOLVE TO: 257 EXT. COURTHOUSE - NIGHT Four or five men loiter around the entrance waiting for the court to begin. Three couples cross the square towards the courthouse entrance. Around the square are cars, trucks, and wagons to which the hitched horses and mules stand sleepily. 258 INT. COLORED BALCONY - NIGHT - JEM, SCOUT, DILL, REV. SYKES Dill is asleep, leaning his head against the Reverend’s shoulder. JEM How long the jury been out now, Reverend? Sykes takes out his watch and looks at it. SYKES Almost an hour. JEM I think that’s an awful good sign, don’t you? Rev. Sykes doesn’t answer him. DISSOLVE TO: 259 INT. COURTROOM - MED. SHOT Heck Tate COMES IN and goes over to Atticus. He whispers to him and then calls out: TATE This Court will come to order. Everyone comes to attention. Tate leaves the room and brings Tom Robinson IN. He takes him to his seat beside Atticus. The jury COMES IN. They, none of them, look at Tom. The Foreman hands a piece of paper to Heck Tate, who hands it to the Clerk, who hands it to the Judge. 121. 260 INT. COLORED BALCONY - CLOSE SHOT - SCOUT, JEM They have shut their eyes from excitement. 261 INT. COURTROOM - ANGLE - JUDGE JUDGE Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? 262 ANOTHER ANGLE - JURORS The Foreman rises. FOREMAN We have, your honor. JUDGE Will the defendant please rise and face the jury. 263 ANGLE - TOM ROBINSON He rises and looks at the jury. JUDGE And what is your verdict? FOREMAN We find the defendant guilty as charged. Judge Taylor starts to say something, but it is lost in the noise of the crowd in the white section starting to go home. Atticus pushes some papers from the table into his brief case. He snaps it shut, goes to the Court Reporter and says: ATTICUS I’d like a copy of the trial. COURT REPORTER Yes, sir. Atticus goes over to Gilmer and they shake hands and then he goes over to Tom. 264 CLOSE TWO SHOT - ATTICUS AND TOM He puts his hand on Tom’s shoulder. He seems very tired. 122. ATTICUS Don’t worry, Tom. I’m going to ask for an appeal. We can still win. A pause. Tom looks up at him but doesn’t answer. ATTICUS Did you hear me, Tom? I say we can still win. Tom looks at him with a kind of mute hopelessness on his face. ATTICUS I’ll go and see Helen first thing in the morning. I told her not to be disappointed, that we’d probably lose this time. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FULL SHOT. Tom is taken away. Atticus leaves the courtroom but not by his usual exit. He walks quickly down the middle aisle to the South exit. Scout is leaning over the rail watching her father and the people below. As atticus walks down the aisle all the Negroes rise. Scout is so busy watching Atticus that she isn’t aware of this. Rev. Sykes taps her on the shoulder. SYKES (whispering Miss Jean Louise... She looks around. SYKES Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father’s passin’. Everyone in the colored balcony remains standing until Atticus leaves the courtroom. After he goes out, the Negroes start to leave the balcony. 265 INT. COLORED BALCONY Rev. Sykes goes among them. Scout and Dill watch the Negroes leave. Jem sits not looking in any particular direction. He is very depressed. The courthouse quickly is cleared of the spectators, and the three children are alone. Scout looks all around the courthouse and sees they are alone. She looks at her brother. She senses his mood and watches him for a beat, and then she and Dill exchange glances. Atticus comes into the balcony. He looks down and sees the children. He goes to them. Jem begins to cry bitterly when he sees his father. 123. 266 EXT. MISS MAUDIE’S PORCH - NIGHT Miss Maudie is alone on her porch. She sees Atticus and the children coming down the sidewalk. She goes out to her yard, Atticus and the children come up to her. MAUDIE I’m sorry, Atticus. ATTICUS Thank you, Maudie. O.S. SOUND: CAR COMING DOWN ROAD. It stops in front of Miss Maudie’s house. Heck Tate gets out. TATE Atticus, can I see you for a minute? ATTICUS Excuse me. He goes to Heck Tate. 267 GROUP SHOT - MISS MAUDIE, JEM, DILL, SCOUT MAUDIE I don’t know if it’ll help, but I want to say this to you. There are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your father’s one of them. JEM (wearily Oh, well. DILL I’m gonna be a clown when I grow up. There ain’t one thing to do about folks but laugh. So I’m gonna join the circus and laugh my head off. SCOUT You got it backwards, Dill. Clowns are sad, it’s folks that laugh at them. DILL I’m gonna be a new kind of clown. I’m gonna stand in the middle of the ring and laugh at the folks. 124. ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE Atticus. Heck Tate is driving off. Atticus stands quietly for a moment and then comes back to them. MAUDIE (sensing something is wrong What’s the matter? ATTICUS Tom Robinson’s dead. A deputy shot him just now. He was a new deputy and when taking him to the jail in the next county for safe keeping, Tom broke loose and ran. Deputy called to him to stop. He fired a few shots in the air and then when Tom didn’t stop, the deputy lost his head, shot towards him, he says, to would him, but missed his aim and killed him. The deputy says Tom just started to run like a crazy man. I don’t understand it. The last thing I told him was not to lose heart, we’d try for an appeal. (a pause) I have to go out to Helen’s and tell her. Would you see to my children, Maudie? MAUDIE Yes, I will, Atticus. Jem starts after him. JEM Want me to go with you, Atticus? ATTICUS No, son, I think I’d better go out alone. He starts for his yard. Jem starts after him. JEM Atticus, I’m coming with you. ATTICUS All right, son. Come on. He waits for Jem to catch up with him. Miss Maudie, Scout and Dill are huddled together, watching them go. DISSOLVE TO: 125. 268 EXT. TOM ROBINSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT The house is dark and quiet as are all the little houses near it. Spence, Tom’s father, sits on the steps of the house. Atticus and Jem drive up to the house. He stops the care and gets out. ATTICUS You wait here, son. JEM Yes, sir. Atticus starts for the yard. Spence sees who it is and comes to him. 269 CLOSE TWO SHOT - ATTICUS, SPENCE SPENCE Hello, Mr. Finch. I’m Spence, Tom’s father. ATTICUS Hello, Spence. Where is Helen? SPENCE She’s inside lying down trying to get a little sleep. I couldn’t sleep and was out here thinkin’ everythin’ over. Helen and I were talking about the appeal. How long do you think that will take, Mr. Finch? ATTICUS Spence, there’ll be no appeal now. You see -- Tom was killed. Was trying to run away and they shot him. ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE Helen COMING OUT the door. She sees the two men. Atticus sees her and starts for her. ATTICUS Helen... Helen gives a little moan and falls over into the dirt of the yard. Spence and Atticus go to her. SPENCE She knew what happened without you even tellin’ her, she knew. 126. Atticus and Spence lift Helen off the ground. She is crying; then she controls herself. Spence and Atticus half carry her into the house. News of Tom’s death has spread among the colored people. Friends are coming into the yard. Bob Ewell comes into the road in front of the yard. He calls to a Negro man at the edge of the yard. EWELL Boy. The Negro man turns and sees who is calling. EWELL Go tell Atticus Finch I said to come out here. The man doesn’t answer, but quietly goes into the house. Atticus comes out of the house. He starts down the steps as Ewell sees him and goes toward him. They meet in the center of the yard. Ewell walks directly up to Atticus and spits in his face. Atticus stares at him for a beat, then wipes his face and starts for the car. EWELL (yelling after him What’s the matter? You too proud to fight? Atticus doesn’t answer or react. He gets in the car beside Jem and they drive off. Ewell turns to a Negro man. EWELL I hear the Sheriff killed him. The Negro man doesn’t answer. He starts for the house. EWELL Well, there’s somebody else needs killin’. DISSOLVE TO: 270 CLOSE SHOT The knothole of the oak is front of the Radley house. The trunk is swelling around the cement patch. The patch itself is turning yellow. Leaves fall from the branches of the tree. CAMERA PULLS BACK as WE SEE the Radley house and sidewalk. 127. JEAN LOUISE’S VOICE By October things had settled down again. I still looked for Boo every time I went by the Radley place. Maybe some day I would still see him. I imagined how it would be when it happened. He’d just be setting on the swing when I came along, “Hidy do, Mr. Arthur,” I would say as if I had said it every afternoon of my life. “Evenin’, Jean Louise,” he would say as if he had said it every afternoon of my life. “Right pretty spell we’re having, isn’t it?” “Yes, sir, right pretty” I would say and go on. Scout and Jem walk past Radley house towards school. Jem has her by the hand and in the other he is carrying a costume that Scout is to wear in a pageant that evening. JEAN LOUISE’S VOICE This night my mind was filled with Halloween. There was to be a pageant representing our country’s agricultural products. I was to be a Ham. My duties, as I gathered from our two rehearsals, were to come on stage left when Miss Stephanie call “Pork.” Jem said he would escort me to the school auditorium. Thus began our longest journey together. 271 EXT. SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT Cars, trucks and farm wagons are parked in front. A few late comers move quickly toward the lighted building and we can HEAR the SOUND of the SCHOOL BAND TUNING UP. DISSOLVE TO: 272 BACKSTAGE - SCHOOL AUDITORIUM The confusion of this amateur theatrical is at its peak. The curtain is about to go up and the adult performers are scrambling for their opening position. Miss Stephanie is in the midst of it all, surrounded by men and women in costumes covering the entire history of Maycomb. 128. Scout, now dressed in her Ham outfit, bumps her way through the crowd and into Miss Stephanie, busily arranging the pages of a tome-like manuscript. SCOUT Miss Stephanie, where am I supposed to -- MISS STEPHANIE Oh heavens, child, my mind is on my pageant. Run on now. We’re about to start. The Band CRASHES into a rousing fanfare. Miss Stephanie clears her throat with a loud COUGH. The curtain is pulled and she charges out onto the stage to great APPLAUSE. Scout, standing in the wings, watches Miss Stephanie place her speech on a bunting draped lectern, and raise her hand for quiet. The Band finishes with a flare and several extra notes from the trumpet section. MISS STEPHANIE Maycomb County -- “Ad Astra Per Asperum.” (BASE DRUM BOOMS THAT MEANS - “From the mud to the Stars.” (BASE DRUM BOOMS The audience APPLAUDS. A man dressed as an Indian bumps into Scout. INDIAN (whispering Move on. Don’t block up the entrance, honey! He pushes her aside. Scout crashes into a woman wearing a hoop skirt BOY’S VOICE(O.S.) C’mon back here, Scout. INDIAN Shhh. Scout stumbles through the crowd of adults and joins the children dressed in costumes representing COTTON, CORN, BEEF, MILK, PEANUTS, etc... DISSOLVE TO: 129. 273 MONTAGE 273-A Stephanie turning pages of her speech, then gestures, as Band plays “Indian War Dance: and Indians march on stage 273-B Scout pressed against wall by men in Revolutionary Uniforms. 273-C Stephanie still turning pages. Band plays a Civil War March. 273-D Two confederate Soldiers and a Souther Belle move past Scout who is leaning against the wall. She yawns. 273-E Stephanie is now almost at the end of her speech. Band plays “Over There.” Soldiers, sailors and marines march on. 273-F Scout is now in a seated position in a corner. CAMERA CLOSES IN to the small face opening and WE CAN SEE she is fast asleep. DISSOLVE 274 THE STAGE The Band finishes a fanfare STEPHANIE Our county has been abundantly blessed with a rich and fertile soil, from which, each year we receive many wonderful products. I now call on the spirit of these products. Beef --- (DRUM ROLL) 275 BACKSTAGE “Beef” steps out as the CAMERA MOVES past CORN, COTTON, PORK, PEANUT and through the legs of the crowd to Scout still asleep and forgotten. MISS STEPHANIE Corn --- (DRUM ROLL) Cotton -- (DRUM ROLL) Peanut --- 130. (MORE) (DRUM ROLL) Pork --- (DRUM ROLL Miss Stephanie’s voice repeats “Pork,” a little more desperately this time. There is another DRUM ROLL. Then one final “Pork,” DRUM ROLL, and the band goes CRASHING into a LOUD version of “DIXIE.” Miss Stephanie comes running. She sees the sleeping Scout. Angrily she shakes her. MISS STEPHANIE I hope you’re satisfied, young lady. You have ruined my pageant. Scout jumps up, looking bewildered. Miss Stephanie stalks OUT of the room. 276 CLOSE SHOT - SCOUT Although most of her face is hidden by her costume, we should feel by the slump of her body that she feels miserable. ANGLE WIDENS as Jem comes running into the room. JEM (almost overly cheerful What happened to you? SCOUT I fell asleep. Miss Stephanie says I ruined her show. JEM Aw, she’s crazy. Come on, take your costume off and we’ll go outside. SCOUT (very subdued No, I think I’ll just keep it on and wait back here until they’ve all gone if you don’t mind. JEM Suit yourself. I’ll come back for you when the coast is clear. SCOUT Okay. 131. MISS STEPHANIE (CONT'D) He GOES outside. She sits back against the wall. DISSOLVE TO: 277 BACKSTAGE It is empty. Only Scout is back there alone. She looks very forlorn. Jem comes running in. JEM Okay. They’ve gone now. Let’s go. He takes her by the hand, picks up her dress, and they start OUT. 278 EXT. OUTSIDE It is black dark out here. JEM Here, Scout, let me hold on to your back. You might lose your balance. SCOUT You should have brought the flashlight, Jem. JEM Didn’t know it would be this dark. 279 MOVING SHOT - SCOUT, JEM They start across the black schoolyard. They move slowly. When they get half way across, Scout stops. SCOUT Jem, I forgot my shoes. JEM Well, let’s go get them. They turn around and go for them. 280 EXT. SCHOOL HOUSE - SCOUT AND JEM’S POV The auditorium lights are turned off. JEM You can get ‘em tomorrow. 132. SCOUT But tomorrow’s Sunday. JEM You can get the janitor to let you in. He turns her around in the direction of their home. JEM Scout --- SCOUT Hun? JEM Nothing. He puts his hand on top of her head and starts guiding her. SCOUT Jem, you don’t hafta. JEM (interrupting) Hush a minute, Scout -- They walk along in silence. SCOUT Minutes’ up. Watch thinkin’ about? JEM (whispering Thought I heard something. Stop a minute. They stop. ",
"JEM Hear anything? SCOUT No. They go about five paces when he makes her stop again. SCOUT Are you tryin’ to scare me, Jem? You know I’m too old. JEM (sternly Be quiet. 133. There is a stillness except for the breathing of the children. Far away a dog HOWLS. SCOUT Heard an old dog then. JEM It’s not that. I hear it when we’re walkin’ along, but when we stop, I don’t hear it. SCOUT (trying to be cheerful but beginning to be genuinely afraid now) You hear my costume rustlin’. Aw, it’s just Halloween got you --- They begin to walk again. We should begin to HEAR the FAINT RUSTLE now that Jem has been talking about. SCOUT I hear it now. I’ll bet it’s just old Cecil Jacobs tryin’ to scare us. Let’s don’t let him think we’re hurrying. They begin to move very slowly now. SCOUT I’m gonna let him know we know he’s behind us (she yells Cecil Jacobs is a big wet hen. They stop. There is not a sound, except the word H--E--N reverberating on the school house wall. JEM (whispering Scout, can you take that off? SCOUT I think so, but I ain’t got anything on under it much. JEM I’ve got your dress here. SCOUT I can’t get it on in the dark. JEM Okay. Never mind. 134. SCOUT Jem, are you afraid? JEM No. Think we’re almost to the tree now. Few yards from that, an’ we’ll be to the road. We can see the street lights then. SCOUT You reckon we ought to sing? JEM No, be real quiet again, Scout. They continue on. We can HEAR more than a RUSTLE of PANTS now. We can HEAR FOOTSTEPS, as if someone were walking behind them in heavy shoes. Jem presses Scout’s head. They stop to listen. SCOUT (whispering I feel the sand cold under my feet, Jem. We’re near the big oak. JEM Shh. They can HEAR SOMEONE RUNNING towards them. JEM (SCREAMING Run, Scout! Run! Run! She takes a big step and she reels. She can’t keep her balance in the dark. SCOUT (in terror Jem, help me! Help me! 281 EXT. SCHOOL YARD UNDER OAK - SCOUT’S POINT OF VIEW It is pitch dark. A form descends on her and grabs her and she falls to the ground and rolls. From nearby, she can HEAR SCUFFLING, KICKING SOUNDS, SOUNDS of SHOES and FLESH SCRAPING DIRT and ROOTS. Jem rolls against her and is up like lightning pulling Scout with him but she is so entangled by the costume they can’t get very far. They are nearly to the road when Jem’s hand leaves her. There is more scuffling and a DULL CRUNCHING SOUND and Scout screams. She sees a MAN’S FORM and runs into it, hitting his stomach with her head. He says “Uf” and grabs her. 135. Suddenly, he is jerked backward and Scout is dragged with him; then she is released. She can see nothing again now but the darkness. She HEARS the SCUFFLING slowly DYING AWAY and then silence. Then she HEARS a HEAVY, BONE SHAKING COUGH. SCOUT (calling Jem. There is no answer but a MAN’S HEAVY BREATHING. SCOUT (calling again Jem. Again no answer. She can see a man now. He GROANS and is pulling something heavy along the ground. The man walks away from her, walking heavily and unsteadily towards the road. 282 BACK TO SCOUT AT THE OAK She moves to where she thought the man was and begins to search frantically on the ground. 283 EXT. THE GROUND UNDER THE OAK - SCOUT’S POINT OF VIEW A body lies there. Scout’s hand touches it. SCOUT Jem. She touches the trousers, a belt buckle, buttons, a collar, a face. It is a man’s face, but it is too dark to tell whose. 284 BACK TO SCOUT ON THE GROUND She makes her way to where she thinks the road is. She looks down the road to the street light. 285 EXT. STREET LIGHT - SCOUT’S POINT OF VIEW A MAN passes under it. He is carrying the limp body of Jem. The man continues on, crosses the Finch front yard, the Finch front door opens and Atticus runs down the steps. 136. 286 BACK TO SCOUT She is at the Radley corner now. In the distance she can hear Atticus say, “Call Dr. Reynolds. Where’s Scout?” 287 MOVING SHOT - SCOUT She crosses to their front yard. We HEAR Calpurnia call: “Here’s Scout.” Calpurnia COMES hurrying OUT of the house, down the steps and towards Scout. SCOUT (calling out) I’m all right, Cal. Cal takes her by the arm and they start for the house. 288 INT. THE HALL OF THE FINCH HOUSE Cal and Scout COME IN. ATTICUS IS AT THE PHONE. ATTICUS Heck? Atticus Finch. Someone’s been after my children. Jem’s hurt. Between here and the schoolhouse. I can’t leave my boy. Run out here, please, and see if he’s still around. Thanks, Heck. He hangs up. He goes to Scout. SCOUT Atticus, is Jem dead? ATTICUS No, Scout. Look after her, Cal. He runs down the hall towards Jem’s room. Cal begins to undress Scout and get her out of the costume. CALPURNIA Are you sure you’re all right? SCOUT Sure. She is free of the costume now and begins to rub her little body. SCOUT Cal, is Jem dead? 137. CUNNINGHAM No, he’s unconscious. We don’t know how badly he’s hurt until Dr. Reynolds gets here. Honey, what happened? SCOUT I swear, I don’t know. Calpurnia rushes OUT of the hall and into Scout’s room and then APPEARS again with clothes for Scout. CALPURNIA Put these on, honey. She hands the clothes to her and rushes down the hall towards Jem’s room. DR. REYNOLDS, in his fifties, carrying his doctor’s bag COMES IN the front door. He takes a look at Scout and pats her on the head. DR. REYNOLDS JEAN LOUISE Well, you’re still standing. He goes past her down the hall to Jem’s room. 289 CLOSE SHOT- SCOUT She is all alone. She glances in terror towards Jem’s room. She slowly puts on her overalls Calpurnia has given her. After she has dressed, she starts slowly down the hall towards Jem’s room. ANGLE WIDENS as the door opens and Dr. Reynolds COMES OUT. He sees Scout and goes to her. SCOUT Is Jem dead? DR. REYNOLDS Far from it. He squats down beside her. 290 TWO SHOT - SCOUT AND DR. REYNOLDS He pats her head. DR. REYNOLDS He has a bump on his head like you and a broken arm. He’s got a bad break, so far as I can tell, like somebody tried to wring his arm off. 138. (MORE) We can’t do much tonight except try to make him as comfortable as possible. We’ll have to X-ray his arm. Looks like he’ll be wearing his arm way out by his side for awhile. Don’t worry though. He’ll be as good as new. Boys his age bounce. While he has been talking to her, DR. REYNOLDS has been fingering her bump and looking keenly at her. DR. REYNOLDS You don’t feel broke anywhere, do you? SCOUT No, sir. DR. REYNOLDS Then go in and look at your brother. ANGLE WIDENS as Heck Tate COMES down the hall. HECK You all right, Scout? SCOUT Yes, sir. I’m goin’ now to see Jem. Atticus is in there. HECK I’ll go with you. 291 INT. JEM’S ROOM The room is dim. Jem’s reading light is shaded with a towel. Jem lies on his back. There is an ugly mark on the side of his face. His left arm is out from the side of his body. The man who brought Jem stands in a corner, leaning against the wall. Atticus is by Jem’s bed. Calpurnia is standing to one side. Scout and Heck Tate COME IN. ATTICUS Come in, Heck. Did you find anything? Heck glances sharply at the man in the corner, nods to him, then looks around the room -- at Jem, Calpurnia and Atticus. 139. DR. REYNOLDS (CONT'D) HECK Mr. Finch, I’ll tell you what I found. I found a little girl’s dress. It’s out there in my car. That your dress, Scout? SCOUT Yes, sir. If it’s pink. HECK An’ I found some funning-lookin’ pieces of muddy colored cloth. SCOUT That was m’ costume. Heck runs his hands down his thighs. He rubs his left arm along the wall of Jem’s room. ATTICUS What is it, Heck? HECK (rubbing his neck Bob Ewell’s lyin’ on the ground under that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. He’s dead, Mr. Finch. Atticus rises. ATTICUS (bleakly Are you sure? HECK Yes, sir. He won’t bother these children again. ATTICUS Maybe we’d better go into the living room, Heck. HECK No, if you don’t mind, I’d rather stay here if it won’t hurt Jem any, and I can have a look at his injuries while Scout tells me what happened. Scout goes to Atticus. He puts his arms around her. Heck goes to Jem and looks at him. HECK You think you can tell us what happened, Miss Scout? 140. SCOUT All of a sudden, somethin’ grabbed me and mashed my costume an’ I ducked and then Mr. Ewell, I reckon, grabbed him again and Jem hollered an’ then somebody grabbed me, Mr. Ewell, I guess, and somebody grabbed him and then I heard somebody pantin’ and coughin’... HECK Who was it? SCOUT Why, there he is, Mr. Tate. He can tell you his name... She points to the MAN in the corner who brought Jem home. He leans against the wall. He has a pale face and his hair is thin and dead white, and as she points to him, a strange spasm shakes him. At this moment it comes to Scout who he is, and she gazes at him in wonder, as a timid smile comes to his face. SCOUT Hey, Boo... ATTICUS (gently correcting her Mr. Arthur, honey. Jean Louise, this is Mr. Arthur Radley. I believe he already know you. Scout is embarrassed and trying to hide her embarrassment. She goes to cover Jem up. Dr. Reynolds COMES back IN. DR. REYNOLDS Everybody out. (glances at Boo Evenin’, Arthur. Didn’t notice you the first time I was here. ATTICUS (glancing at Boo) Er -- Heck, let’s go out on the front porch. There are plenty of chairs out there and it’s still warm enough. Atticus and Heck Tate GO ON OUT. Scout goes to ARthur. 141. SCOUT Come along, Mr. Arthur. You don’t know the house real well. I’ll take you to the porch, sir. He looks down at Scout and nods. She leads him out of the door. 292 EXT. FING FRONT PORCH - NIGHT Atticus and Heck Tate are there. Scout brings Arthur out. SCOUT Won’t you have a seat, Mr. Arthur? This rocking chair’s nice and comfortable. She leads him to the chair farthest from Atticus and Heck. It is in deep shadow. Atticus is seated in the swing, Heck on a chair next to him. Scout sits next to Arthur. 293 TWO SHOT - ATTICUS AND HECK ATTICUS Well, Heck, I guess the thing to do -- Good Lord, I’m losing my memory. 294 ANGLE FAVORING ATTICUS Atticus pushes up his glasses and presses his fingers to his eyes. ATTICUS I can’t remember if Jem is ten or eleven. Anyway, it will come before the County court. Of course, it was a clear cut case of self-defense, but I’ll have to go to the office and hunt up -- 295 ANGLE FAVORING TATE TATE Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think that? ATTICUS You heard what Scout said. 142. TATE (quietly, firmly Mr. Finch, Bob Ewell fell on his knife. He killed himself. Your boy never stabbed him. Atticus walks to the corner of the porch and looks at the wisteria vine. TATE (exploding There’s a black man dead for no reason, and now the man responsible for it is dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. I never heard tell that it’s against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed, which is exactly what he did, but maybe you’ll say it’s my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up. Know what’d happen then? All the ladies in Maycomb, includin’ my wife, ‘d be knockin’ on his door bringin’ angel food cakes. To my way of thinkin’, Mr. Finch, takin’ the one man who’s done you and this town a great service, and draggin’ him with his shy ways into the limelight... To me, that’s a sin. It’s a sin and I’m not about to have it on my head. He is trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot. Atticus looks over at Boo. Heck’s meaning dawns on him. TATE I may not be much, Mr. Finch, but I’m still Sheriff of Maycomb County, and Bob Ewell fell on his knife. Good night, sir. He LEAVES. O.S. SOUND: CAR DRIVING OFF Atticus looks out into the yard and then over at Scout. ATTICUS Scout, Mr. Ewell fell on his knife. Do you think you can possibly understand? 143. 296 TWO SHOT - SCOUT AND ATTICUS SCOUT Yes, sir. I understand. Mr. Tate was right. ATTICUS What do you mean? SCOUT Well, it would be sort of like shooting a mockingbird, wouldn’t it? Atticus puts his face in her hair and rubs it. ANGLE WIDENS as Atticus gets up and starts for the house. Before he goes inside, he stops in front of Arthur Radley. ATTICUS Thank you for my children, Arthur. He goes on inside. Arthur gets up and nods toward the front door. SCOUT You’d like to say good night to Jem, wouldn’t you, Mr. Arthur? Come right in. They go in the door. 297 INT. HALLWAY Scout and Arthur COME IN. They go to the door of Jem’s room. 298 INT. JEM’S ROOM Scout and Arthur ENTER. SCOUT Dr. Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative, Cal says, so he’d sleep. Scout leads him to Jem’s bed. Arthur looks at him from head to foot as though he had never seen a boy before. His hand comes up, but he lets it drop to his side. SCOUT You can pet him, Mr. Arthur. He’s asleep. You couldn’t if he was awake, though, he wouldn’t let you. Go ahead. 144. His hand comes lightly on Jem’s hair. Then he tugs at Scout’s arm and she understands he wants to leave. They GO OUT. 299 INT. HALLWAY Scout and Arthur ENTER from Jem’s room. She leads him to the font door. They stand there. He holds her hand. ARTHUR (whispering Will you take me home? SCOUT Mr. Arthur, bend your arm down here like that. That’s right, sir. She slips her hand into the crook of his arm. They walk out the front door. 300 EXT. FING FRONT PORCH AND SIDEWALK - MOVING SHOT - NIGHT They walk in the yard, up the walk and onto the Radley porch. Arthur finds the door knob and goes in, leaving Scout alone on the porch. JEAN LOUISE (V.O.) Neighbors bring food with death, and flowers with sickness, and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a knife and our lives. One time Atticus said you never really knew a man until you stood in his shoes and walked around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was enough. 301 MOVING SHOT Scout starts home. A fine rain is falling. She runs up the steps and goes into her house. DISSOLVE TO: 302 INT. JEM’S BEDROOM Atticus is there, sitting beside Jem’s bed. 145. SCOUT Has Jem waked up yet? ATTICUS Sleeping peacefully. He won’t wake until morning. She climbs into his lap. JEAN LOUISE (V.O.) Well, the summer that had begun so long ago had ended, and another summer had taken its place, and a fall, and Boo Radley had come out and Jem was to live. I was to think of these days many times, of Jem, and Dill and Boo Radley and Tom Robinson and the Ewells and Atticus -- his fairness, his stubbornness, his devotion, his courage, his love. 303 EXT. FINCH HOUSE - JEM’S WINDOW We can SEE Atticus through the window, sitting by his son’s bed, holding Scout. JEAN LOUISE (V.O.) He would be in Jem’s room all night and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning. CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK as Atticus looks at the sleeping Jem. FADE OUT THE END 146. "
